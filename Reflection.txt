I did not face any significant challenges throughout the project. I feel like I have a good handle on all the data types, data structures, and programming techniques in java that we have learned. The project was easy to develop overall. By developing layer by layer, I could include all the features I wanted to. However, I sometimes felt that it would have been easier to include certain features since the beginning instead of having a layer by layer development. Nothing was hard nonetheless. It was also easier because part of the code was developed previously, however, I did not use as much code from the previous assignment as I thought I would. Furthermore, I decided to challenge myself with this assignment. I knew I wanted to include additional features like reading and writing files so data is not lost and the balance and deposit history of the users is not lost when the ATM closes, and an encrypted pin. I also wanted to include an admin feature where certain aspects of each account can be accessed. The first additional feature, however, was the hacker feature that, out of the three, was the easiest and shortest to implement. Each additional feature I added was a new layer. I am actually proud of myself for having learned the basics of files by myself; it was a challenge. It was honestly very fun and extremely satisfying and fulfilling in the end. Self-guided learning is something very important to me. I am proud of my PA2. Moreover, I can add even more features to this project in the future to make it safer and closer to something that would be used in the real world, potentially showing an employer all of my capabilities and knowledge.
